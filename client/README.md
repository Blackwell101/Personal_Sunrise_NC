  ## Description 
  Beach rental home MVP for Personal Sunrise in NC.  Created with REACT, MongoDB, Apollo Server, React Router, and JWT (Jason Web Tokens).  User is welcomed to the home page (slideshow, reviews, and description), can create an account to request a booking or utilize the footer links to check the property on AirBNB and VRBO.  The user can also create a message for the owner (currently contained with a `console.log`).  If a user chooses to not create an account, they will still have the ability to observe the calendar, navigate to external links, and send an email to owner.
